# SharksFootsteps

I own the copyrights of the files in the folder "videos", however, the other folders, "graphic","music" belong to the creators.

This game was initially made as an interactive art with my schoolmates in 2021, and at the time, I was only in charge of making videos.
Later I have decided brush the system up and make a game out of it.

This game uses OpenCV to recognize your face, and you are supposed to hide your face when Shark comes up. You can try to take a picture with Shark by smilling without getting noticed by it.
